         <p>Professional photography course Graduated in 2016 by Escola de Moda Lisboa and ready for new work experiences. I am currently studying graphic and multimedia design at Escola Superior Artes e Design. 
        Creativity and freedom are my mottos as a worker. Most of my learnings were through my travels and connections with different cultures, which was important for me to become the professional person I am today. Look, sketch, think and carry out the project with all possible compassion and with open arms for the team that has to deal with it.</p>
